# Simple-Executor
A Lua script executor for Roblox  
Simple Executor is a very basic executor for executing Lua scripts into Roblox  

# Executor currently uses:
WEAREDEVS_API.dll  

I will add other attachers like krnl, etc so you will be able to choose from a array of dlls  
I will also try and make the UI alot more better when v0.0.2 is released
